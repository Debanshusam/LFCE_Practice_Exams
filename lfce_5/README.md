## Instructions

Complete the tasks to the best of your ability. Use your best judgement when completing the tasks.

## Equipment Requirements

- CentOS 7
- two machines (virtual, preferable)

## Pre-work

Create two servers with two physical volumes (at least 5 gigabytes each) and two network interfaces connected.

- server01.example.com
- server02.example.com

Install  the OS on one of the volumes using the default partitioning. Leave the other volume alone for the tasks.

Both machine should be reachable to each other. They also must be able to download packages from the internet.

Default password should be root1234.

## Note

Most of the work must be done with firewall and selinux enabled.	

## Tasks

TBD. This likely going to be very firewall/Network ACL based.
