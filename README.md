This is a list of practice exams I made for myself to get ready for the Linux Foundation Certified Engineer (LFCE) exam. If you have any suggestions or questions, please post on the issue page or submit a pull request.
## Disclaimer

I have not seen the exam and even if I did, I would not disclose any details of the exam. I am just going off from the exam objectives here:

Posting of LFCE exam material would be in violation of NDA and will be removed summarily.
